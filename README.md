# Memory Lane
My capstone project for TCNJ's IMM program, 2013

## Abstract

*Memory Lane* is a study on human interaction and its effects on a video game experience.  Players will enter an amnesiac's dreams in order to save his life.  They will experience his dreams as they would in reality through real-world gestures and vocal input, as processed by the motion-sensing, microphone-enabled Kinect sensor.  

##  Well...

That's what it would do if I managed to implement all the functionality.  As it is, Memory Lane is currently a proof-of-concept. Doesn't help that the tracking tech I used - the Omek Motion Toolkit - has since gone to the Country.  If you'd like to expand on the idea with new motion tech (like, say, Zigfu or the like), then by all means go ahead and fork.
